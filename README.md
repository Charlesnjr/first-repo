# lesson 1
first practice in git/github.I have learnt good introduction from Gwenf tutorials. 
first project is challenging.
moving forth and back trying find and fix the code.
very confused and feeling dump, when you don't understand.
but step by step, you get a thing right here and a thing right there.
and shout halleluyah, 
waiting for breakthrough in the next puzzle.
